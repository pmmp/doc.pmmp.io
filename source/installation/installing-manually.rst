Installing manually
-------------------

No installer available for your platform? Did the installer fail? It is not your taste? YOLO? DIY!

Getting PHP for your server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download your flavor PHP binary (:ref:`Downloads <downloads>`)
2. Extract the PHP binary into your server directory. If everything went well, you should have a ``bin`` folder in your server directory.
3. (Windows only) Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2019 (:ref:`Downloads <downloads>`)

Getting PocketMine-MP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a new directory for PocketMine-MP.
2. Download PocketMine-MP.phar (:ref:`Downloads <downloads>`)
3. Rename the .phar to ``PocketMine-MP.phar``.
4. Place it in the PocketMine-MP directory you just created.
5. Get the start script for your platform (`Windows CMD <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/start.cmd>`_, `Windows PowerShell <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/start.ps1>`_, `Linux/MacOS bash <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/start.sh>`_)
6. (Linux/MacOS only) Make start.sh executable (chmod +x start.sh)
