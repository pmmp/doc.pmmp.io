PocketMine-MP Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PocketMine-MP is a custom server software for the Minecraft: Bedrock family of Minecraft editions (includes Android, iOS, W10 and others).

What features does it have?
===========================
- A powerful plugin API, which allows you to extend and customize your server far more easily and extensively than any competing server implementations, including the official vanilla server.
- Multi-world support, allowing you to offer a more varied game experience to players without transferring them to other server nodes.
- Performance fit to hold 100+ players (depends on hardware, see the `requirements <installation/requirements.html>`_ section).
- Continuously updated to support latest Minecraft versions. PocketMine-MP has the longest and best track record of any custom server for compatibility with new Minecraft versions.
