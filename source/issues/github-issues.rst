Using the GitHub Issue Tracker
==============================
Did your server crash, or did you encounter a bug?

- Make sure you're using the latest available version of PocketMine-MP, as the bug might already have been fixed.
- Try and reproduce it **WITHOUT PLUGINS**, as plugins can frequently cause issues.
- Ask for help on our `forums`_ before creating an issue.

.. warning::
    Please **do not** use our issue tracker for support requests, but instead seek assistance on the `forums`_ or our `community Discord`_. Support request issues will be closed as per the contribution guidelines.

.. note::
    Make sure you read the `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue>`_ before creating an issue.

If your issue is still unresolved and you're sure the issue is caused by PocketMine-MP itself, then `make a new issue <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/new>`_ on GitHub.

Issue template
